## Installation

Pre-compiled binaries are provided for Linux from the [release
page](https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit/releases). We recommend the use of these in
most circumstances. As a rust-based project, `modkit` can also be installed with 
[cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit.git
cd modkit
cargo install --path .
# or
cargo install --git https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit.git
```
