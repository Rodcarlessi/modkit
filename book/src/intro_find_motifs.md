# Find highly modified motif sequences

The `modkit find-motifs` command will attempt to summarize short genome sequences (motifs) that are more found to be highly modified (i.e. enriched for methylation).
The input to this command is a bedMethyl generated by `modkit pileup` and the reference sequence used.
For example, to run the command with default settings (recommended):

```bash
bedmethyl=/path/to/pileup.bed
ref=/path/to/reference.fasta

modkit motif search \
  -i ${bedmethyl} \
  -r ${ref} \
  -o ./motifs.tsv \
  --threads 32 \
  --log ./modkit_find_motifs_log.txt 
```

Specifying an output with `-o` will generate a machine-readable tab-separated-values file, a human-readable version of the table will always be logged to the terminal and the logfile.

## Output format

All output tables are output in two formats, machine-readable and human-readable.
The human-readable tables are always output to the log and terminal, the machine-readable tables are output to files specified on the command line.

## Specifying known motifs

Multiple motif sequences suspected to be present can be specified with the `--known-motif` option.
A machine-readable table of the motif sequences that are not found during the search can be specified with the `--known-motifs-table` option.
Using this option will add two columns to the above tables:

| name                | description                                                                                                | type |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| status              | equal, Subset, Superset, or Disjoint describes the relationship of the discovered motif to the known motif | str  |
| closest_known_motif | of all motifs specified with `--known-motif` the one that is most similar to the discovered motif          | str  |

If any of the known motifs are not found during the search process an additional table is also emitted in machine- and human-readable versions.

## Simple description of the search algorithm

The first step in `find-motifs` is to categorize each genomic position in the pileup into one of three groups based on the `fraction modified` [column in the bedMethyl](./intro_pileup.md#bedmethyl-column-descriptions):

- Low-modified
- Mid-modified
- High-modified

The threshold values for each group can be set on the command line (`--high-thresh` and `--low-thresh`).
For example, consider a high threshold of 0.6 and a low threshold of 0.2 the following 3 bedMethyl records would be put into the high-, low-, and mid-groups, respectively:

```text
contig1      6       7       a       27      -       6       7       255,0,0 27      96.30   26      1       0       0       3       0       0
contig1      8       9       a       24      -       8       9       255,0,0 24      4.17    1       23      0       0       5       1       0
contig1      218     219     a       21      +       218     219     255,0,0 21      28.57   6       15      0       2       3       0       0
```

The sequence around each modified position is then collected from the reference FASTA file.
The length of the sequence can be set with the `--context-size` option, accepting two values: the number of bases upstream and the number of bases downstream of the modified location. 
For example `--context-size 12 12` will collect 12 bases upstream and 12 bases downstream of the modified base for a maximum motif length of 25 base pairs.
The algorithm then iteratively expands, contracts, and merges sequences while the following criteria are met:

- The number of occurrences in the high-modified set is greater than `min_sites` (set by `--min-sites`).
- The fraction \\( \frac{\textit{H}}{\textit{H} + \textit{L}} \\), is greater than `frac_mod` (set with `--min-frac-mod`),  where \\( \textit{H} \\) and \\( \textit{L} \\) is the number of total sequence contexts in the high-modified and low-modified set, respectively.
- The log-odds of the context being in the high-modified category is greater than `min_log_odds` (set with `--min-log-odds`).

Once a motif sequence cannot be changed (made more general or more restrictive) without violating one of these criteria, the motif sequence is considered complete.
As the algorithm continues, context sequences that match discovered sequences are removed from consideration.

A secondary search step is also performed by starting with every k-mer (where k is less than the total sequence length, 3 by default, set with `--exhaustive-seed-len`) at every motif position.
The log-odds threshold for this search is usually higher and set with `--exhaustive-seed-min-log-odds`.
Decreasing this value can drastically increase computational time.

## Tuning parameters and `--skip-search`

The default parameters have been picked to be sufficiently sensitive, however if you decide to adjust the parameters in general increasing sensitivity will increase compute time.
1. Increasing the `--min-frac-mod` will stop search earlier which will decrease compute time.
1. Decreasing `--min-sites` has the largest effect and can especially cause the secondary search to crawl more sequences. 
Decreasing `--min-sites` along with `--skip-search` may be a useful technique to find very rare sequence motifs.
1. Increasing `--exhaustive-seed-min-log-odds` can drastically decrease compute time (sometimes while maintaining sensitivity).
