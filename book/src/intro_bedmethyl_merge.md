# Merge multiple bedMethyl files

If you generate bedMethyl [tables](./intro_pileup.md#description-of-bedmethyl-output) from multiple samples and want to perform a "join" where the counts summed `modkit bedmethyl merge` will perform an outer join for you.
An example command is below:

```bash
modkit bedmethyl merge sample_a.bed.gz sample_b.bed.gz \
  -o samples_a_and_b.bed \
  -g genome_sizes.tsv # could be reference.fa.fai
```

The input bedMethyl files must be bgzipped and tabix indexed. 

```bash
bgzip sample_a.bed
tabix sample_a.bed.gz

bgzip sample_b.bed
tabix sample_b.bed.gz
```

The `genome_sizes.tsv` is a tab-separated file containing the lengths of the contigs in the reference sequence, you can also use a .fai file generated by `samtools faidx`.

For example taken from `bedtools`: 

The schema should be `<chromName><TAB><chromSize>`.

For example, Human (hg19):

```text
chr1    249250621
chr2    243199373
```
