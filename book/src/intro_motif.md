# Working with sequence motifs

The `modkit motif` suite contains tools for discovery and exploration of short degenerate sequences (motifs) that may be enriched in a sample. 
A common use case is to discover the motifs enriched for modification in a native bacterial sample which can give indication of methyltransferase enzymes present in the genomes present in the sample.

The following tools are available:

1. [Find enriched motifs _de novo_ from a bedMethyl with `search`.](,/intro_find_motifs.md)
1. [`evaluate` or `refine` a table of known motifs](./evaluate_motif.md)
4. [Making a motif BED file with `motif bed`](./intro_motif_bed.md)
